The coding team has successfully completed the TDD workflow to build a simple todo list API with add, delete, and mark complete functionality. Here is a summary of the team's activities:

### Team Members Involved:
- Planner
- Designer
- Test Writer
- Coder
- Reviewer

### Project Plan:
- The project overview, technical requirements, task breakdown, architecture recommendations, risk assessment, estimated time, and priority were defined by the planner.

### Technical Design:
- The designer created a comprehensive technical design including System Architecture Overview, Component Design, Data Models and Schemas, API Specifications, Interface Definitions, and Design Patterns and Guidelines.

### Test Scenarios:
- The test writer developed detailed test scenarios for adding tasks, deleting tasks, marking tasks as complete, API documentation generation, unit testing API endpoints, deployment to a cloud platform, and monitoring API performance.

### Implementation Details:
- The coder implemented the todo list API with functionalities for adding, deleting, and marking tasks as complete. Files including requirements.txt, app.py, swagger.py, README.md, and test_app.py were generated.

### Code Review:
- The reviewer conducted a code review focusing on code quality, security, performance, and test adherence.

The todo list API is now ready for use.
