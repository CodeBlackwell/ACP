# DEVELOPER CONTEXT NOTES:
# 
# 1. PROMPT EVOLUTION: These prompts should evolve based on agent performance metrics
#    and pipeline effectiveness. Monitor agent outputs and refine prompts iteratively.
# 
# 2. COGNITIVE SPECIALIZATION: Each agent is designed for specific cognitive functions.
#    Avoid prompt overlap that could cause role confusion or duplicate work.
# 
# 3. INTEGRATION AWARENESS: Agents must understand their position in the pipeline
#    and format outputs for consumption by downstream agents.
# 
# 4. HUMAN REVIEW INTEGRATION: Prompts should generate outputs suitable for human
#    review at milestone checkpoints, with clear formatting and decision support.
# 
# 5. ERROR HANDLING: All agents should handle ambiguous inputs gracefully and
#    request clarification rather than making incorrect assumptions.
# 
# 6. PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATION: Monitor token usage and response times. Adjust
#    prompt complexity if agents become bottlenecks in the pipeline.
