The coding team has been coordinated to build a simple blog API with posts and comments. Here is the breakdown of the workflow:

### Project Plan: Building a Simple Blog API with Posts and Comments

#### Project Overview
The project aims to develop a simple blog API that allows users to create, read, update, and delete posts and comments. The API will provide endpoints for managing posts and associated comments, enabling basic CRUD operations.

#### Technical Requirements
- **Programming Language**: Choose a suitable language for API development (e.g., Node.js, Python, Java).
- **Framework**: Select a framework that facilitates API development (e.g., Express.js, Flask, Spring Boot).
- **Database**: Implement a database to store posts and comments (e.g., MySQL, MongoDB).
- **API Documentation**: Use tools like Swagger or Postman for API documentation.
- **Authentication**: Implement user authentication to secure API endpoints.
- **Testing**: Write unit tests to ensure API functionality and reliability.
- **Deployment**: Deploy the API on a cloud platform like AWS, Azure, or Heroku.

#### Task Breakdown
- **Planning Phase**: Define project requirements, select technologies, create timeline.
- **Development Phase**: Set up environment, implement endpoints, integrate database, authentication, tests.
- **Documentation Phase**: Generate API documentation.
- **Testing Phase**: Perform unit and integration testing.
- **Deployment Phase**: Prepare and deploy the API.

#### Architecture Recommendations
- Follow RESTful design principles, use JWT tokens, implement data validation, consider scalability.

#### Risk Assessment
- Technical, Resource, and Operational risks identified.

The team members involved are:
- Planner
- Designer
- Test Writer
- Coder
- Reviewer

The project is progressing according to the TDD workflow.
