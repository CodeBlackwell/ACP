# Flagship Self-Containment Migration Notes

## What Was Done

This document describes the changes made to make Flagship completely self-contained.

### 1. Created Parent Compatibility Layer

**File**: `models/parent_compatibility.py`
- Provides `TeamMember` and `TeamMemberResult` classes
- Allows Flagship to work without importing from parent system's `shared.data_models`

### 2. Updated Agent Coordinator

**File**: `workflows/tdd_orchestrator/agent_coordinator.py`
- Changed imports from `shared.data_models` to `models.parent_compatibility`
- Now uses local compatibility models instead of parent system models

### 3. Created Parent System Adapter

**File**: `integrations/parent_system_adapter.py`
- Provides `execute_tdd_workflow_for_parent()` function
- Allows parent system to use Flagship without direct coupling
- Handles conversion between Flagship and parent system formats

### 4. Updated Parent System Integration

**File**: `../workflows/tdd_orchestrator.py` (parent system)
- Now imports from Flagship's adapter instead of trying to import internal components
- Simplified to just delegate to Flagship's adapter function

### 5. Documentation

- **ARCHITECTURE.md**: Comprehensive documentation of Flagship's architecture
- **MIGRATION_NOTES.md**: This file documenting the changes

## Benefits

1. **True Independence**: Flagship can now run completely standalone
2. **Clean Integration**: Parent system uses a clean adapter interface
3. **No Circular Dependencies**: All imports flow in one direction
4. **Maintainability**: Changes to either system won't break the other

## Testing

Run the following to verify everything works:

```bash
# Test standalone mode
./runflagship.sh "Create a simple calculator"

# Test imports
python -c "from flagship_orchestrator import FlagshipOrchestrator"

# Test parent compatibility
python -c "from integrations.parent_system_adapter import execute_tdd_workflow_for_parent"
```

## Future Considerations

1. The parent system adapter could be moved to the parent system if desired
2. Additional adapters could be created for other systems
3. The compatibility layer could be extended as needed

## Migration Complete âœ…

Flagship is now a fully self-contained TDD orchestration system that can work independently or as part of larger systems through clean adapter interfaces.
