## Plan

PLAN FOR: Create a simple REST API for a todo list

1. Define the endpoints for the API, such as GET /todos to retrieve all todos and POST /todos to create a new todo.
2. Set up a server using a framework like Express.js in Node.js to handle incoming HTTP requests.
3. Implement the logic for each endpoint, such as querying a database to retrieve or store todo items.
4. Test the API endpoints using tools like Postman to ensure they work as expected.
5. Deploy the API to a server or platform like Heroku to make it accessible to clients.
