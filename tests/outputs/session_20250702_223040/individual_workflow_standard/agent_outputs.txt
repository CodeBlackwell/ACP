# Project Plan: Simple Express.js TODO API

## Project Overview
The project aims to create a simple Express.js TODO API with the following endpoints: GET /todos, POST /todos, GET /todos/:id, PUT /todos/:id, DELETE /todos/:id. This API will allow users to manage a list of TODO items.

## Technical Requirements
1. Node.js and Express.js for backend development.
2. MongoDB for storing TODO data.
3. Mongoose for interacting with the MongoDB database.
4. Postman for API testing.
5. Git for version control.
6. Docker for containerization (optional).

## Task Breakdown
1. **Setup Project**
   - Initialize Node.js project.
   - Install Express.js and set up the basic server.
   - Set up MongoDB database and connect to the Express.js app.

2. **Create Endpoints**
   - Implement GET /todos to fetch all TODO items.
   - Implement POST /todos to create a new TODO item.
   - Implement GET /todos/:id to get a specific TODO item.
   - Implement PUT /todos/:id to update a TODO item.
   - Implement DELETE /todos/:id to delete a TODO item.

3. **Data Modeling**
   - Define the schema for TODO items.
   - Create Mongoose models for interacting with MongoDB.

4. **Testing**
   - Test each endpoint using Postman.
   - Write unit tests for the API endpoints.

5. **Documentation**
   - Document API endpoints, request/response formats.
   - Provide instructions for setting up and running the project.

6. **Deployment**
   - Deploy the API to a hosting service (e.g., Heroku, AWS).
   - Set up CI/CD pipeline for automated deployments.

## Architecture Recommendations
- Use MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture for better code organization.
- Implement middleware for error handling and request validation.
- Secure the API endpoints with authentication (JWT tokens).
- Implement logging for monitoring and debugging.

## Risk Assessment
1. **Technical Risks**
   - Compatibility issues between Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB versions.
   - Inadequate error handling leading to security vulnerabilities.
   
2. **Resource Risks**
   - Limited experience with Node.js and Express.js.
   - Insufficient testing leading to bugs in production.

3. **Timeline Risks**
   - Delays in setting up the development environment.
   - Unforeseen complexities in implementing specific endpoints.
