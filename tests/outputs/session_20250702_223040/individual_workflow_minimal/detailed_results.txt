# Project Overview
The project aims to create a simple 'Hello World' REST API endpoint to demonstrate basic API development skills.

# Technical Requirements
1. Programming Language: Choose a language suitable for REST API development (e.g., Python, Node.js).
2. Framework: Select a framework that simplifies API development (e.g., Flask for Python, Express for Node.js).
3. API Endpoint: Implement a single endpoint that returns a "Hello World" message.
4. Testing: Include unit tests to ensure the endpoint functions correctly.
5. Documentation: Provide clear documentation on how to use the API.

# Task Breakdown
1. **Setup Development Environment**
   - Choose the programming language and framework.
   - Set up a new project repository.

2. **Create 'Hello World' Endpoint**
   - Define the API endpoint route.
   - Implement the logic to return "Hello World".
   - Test the endpoint locally.

3. **Unit Testing**
   - Write unit tests to verify the endpoint functionality.
   - Run tests to ensure the endpoint behaves as expected.

4. **Documentation**
   - Create API documentation detailing how to interact with the endpoint.
   - Include information on endpoint URL, request method, and expected response.

5. **Integration Testing (Optional)**
   - Perform integration testing to validate the API's behavior in a simulated environment.

# Architecture Recommendations
- Follow RESTful principles for designing the API.
- Use appropriate error handling mechanisms.
- Consider scalability and potential future endpoints when structuring the project.

# Risk Assessment
- **Time Constraints:** Ensure tasks are completed within the specified timeline.
- **Dependency on External Services:** Minimize dependencies on external services for the 'Hello World' functionality.
- **Security Concerns:** Implement basic security measures to protect the API from common vulnerabilities.

Estimated Time: 1-2 days
Priority: Medium
