However, consider adding input validation and error handling for more complex applications.\n\n#### Best Practices:\n- The use of `debug=True` in production is not recommended. It should be set to `False` or removed in a production environment.\n- The code is well-structured, and the separation of concerns is maintained with the tests and documentation.\n\n#### Testing:\n- The test cases cover the essential functionality of the API, ensuring that the endpoint returns the correct status code and response format.\n- Consider adding more tests for edge cases, such as handling invalid requests.\n\n#### Documentation:\n- The README file provides clear setup instructions, which is helpful for users.\n- The acceptance criteria are well-defined and align with the implementation.\n\n### Final Decision:\nAPPROVED. The implementation is functional and meets the core requirements for a basic REST API.', content_encoding='plain', content_url=None, metadata=None)], created_at=datetime.datetime(2025, 7, 5, 0, 13, 33, 388636, tzinfo=TzInfo(UTC)), completed_at=datetime.datetime(2025, 7, 5, 0, 13, 33, 389589, tzinfo=TzInfo(UTC)))]
