The architecture will follow the MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern, ensuring a modular and maintainable structure. The API will have a single endpoint that responds with a JSON object.\n\n# Component Design\n1. **API Server**: The main application that handles incoming requests and routes them to the appropriate controller.\n2. **Controller**: Manages the logic for handling requests and responses.\n3. **Model**: Represents the data structure (though minimal for this project).\n4. **View**: In this case, the view is represented by the JSON response.\n\n# Data Models and Schemas\n- **No complex data models are required for this basic API.** The response will be a simple JSON object.\n\n# API Specifications\n- **Endpoint**: `/hello`\n- **Method**: GET\n- **Response**: \n  ```json\n  {\n    "message": "Hello World"\n  }\n  ```\n\n# Interface Definitions\n- **GET /hello**: Returns a JSON object with a "Hello World" message.\n\n# Design Patterns and Guidelines\n- Use the MVC pattern for organization.\n- Keep the application lightweight and modular.\n- Ensure proper error handling and response formatting.\n\n# IMPLEMENTATION PLAN\n===================\n\nFEATURE[1]: Set Up Development Environment\nDescription: Install necessary software and set up a Git repository.\nFiles: README.md\nValidation: Environment is set up correctly, and Git repository is initialized.\nDependencies: None\nEstimated Complexity: Low\n\nFEATURE[2]: Create Basic API Structure\nDescription: Initialize the project and create the main application file.\nFiles: app.py (Flask) or server.js (Express)\nValidation: Application starts without errors.\nDependencies: FEATURE[1]\nEstimated Complexity: Low\n\nFEATURE[3]: Implement \'Hello World\' Endpoint\nDescription: Define a route for the `/hello` endpoint and return a JSON response.\nFiles: app.py (Flask) or server.js (Express)\nValidation: Sending a GET request to `/hello` returns the correct JSON response.\nDependencies: FEATURE[2]\nEstimated Complexity: Medium\n\nFEATURE[4]: Test the API Endpoint\nDescription: Use Postman to test the `/hello` endpoint.\nFiles: None (testing documentation)\nValidation: Successful GET request returns the expected JSON response.\nDependencies: FEATURE[3]\nEstimated Complexity: Low\n\nFEATURE[5]: Documentation\nDescription: Write a README file explaining how to run the API and test the endpoint.\nFiles: README.md\nValidation: README provides clear instructions for setup and testing.\nDependencies: FEATURE[4]\nEstimated Complexity: Low\n\nFEATURE[6]: Version Control\nDescription: Commit changes to the Git repository and push to a remote repository.\nFiles: None (version control actions)\nValidation: Changes are committed and pushed successfully.\nDependencies: FEATURE[5]\nEstimated Complexity: Low', content_encoding='plain', content_url=None, metadata=None)], created_at=datetime.datetime(2025, 7, 5, 0, 28, 49, 586741, tzinfo=TzInfo(UTC)), completed_at=datetime.datetime(2025, 7, 5, 0, 28, 49, 587617, tzinfo=TzInfo(UTC)))]
