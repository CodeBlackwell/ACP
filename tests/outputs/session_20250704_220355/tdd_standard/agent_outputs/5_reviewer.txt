Consider adding these features if sensitive data is involved.\n- Ensure that the MongoDB connection string is not exposed in the codebase for production environments.\n\n#### Best Practices\n- The error handling middleware is a good addition, but consider enhancing it to handle different types of errors more gracefully.\n- The validation schema using Joi is well-implemented, ensuring that the data conforms to expected formats before processing.\n\n#### Testing\n- The test cases cover the main functionalities of the API, which is good. However, consider adding tests for edge cases, such as invalid IDs and malformed requests.\n- Integration tests are mentioned but not implemented in the provided test file. It would be beneficial to ensure that all endpoints work together as expected.\n\n### Final Decision\nAPPROVED. The implementation is functional and addresses core requirements, but consider the suggestions for security and testing improvements.', content_encoding='plain', content_url=None, metadata=None)], created_at=datetime.datetime(2025, 7, 5, 2, 4, 59, 955109, tzinfo=TzInfo(UTC)), completed_at=datetime.datetime(2025, 7, 5, 2, 4, 59, 956220, tzinfo=TzInfo(UTC)))]
