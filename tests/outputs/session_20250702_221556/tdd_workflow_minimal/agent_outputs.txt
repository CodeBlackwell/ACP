# Project Plan: Creating a 'Hello World' REST API Endpoint

## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to develop a simple 'Hello World' REST API endpoint that responds with a greeting message. This API will serve as a basic demonstration of setting up a RESTful service.

## Technical Requirements
- Programming Language: Python
- Framework: Flask
- REST API Endpoint: /hello
- HTTP Method: GET
- Response Format: JSON
- Response Data: {"message": "Hello, World!"}

## Task Breakdown
1. **Setup Development Environment**
   - Install Python and Flask
2. **Create Flask Application**
   - Define a Flask application
   - Create a route for the '/hello' endpoint
3. **Implement API Endpoint**
   - Define a function to handle GET requests to '/hello'
   - Return a JSON response with the greeting message
4. **Testing**
   - Test the API endpoint using tools like Postman or cURL
5. **Documentation**
   - Document the API endpoint, its purpose, and usage

## Architecture Recommendations
- Use Flask for its simplicity and ease of use in building REST APIs.
- Follow RESTful principles for designing the API endpoint.
- Keep the project structure simple since it's a basic implementation.

## Risk Assessment
- **Time Constraints:** Ensure timely completion by focusing on essential features.
- **Dependency on External Libraries:** Minimize dependencies to avoid compatibility issues.
- **Security:** Implement basic security measures to prevent common vulnerabilities.

Feel free to ask if you need more details or clarification on any part of the project plan.

2. DESIGNER OUTPUT:
==================================================

### System Architecture Overview
The system will consist of a Flask application running a 'Hello World' REST API endpoint. It will handle GET requests to the '/hello' endpoint and respond with a JSON message containing "Hello, World!".

### Component Design
1. **Flask Application**
   - Define a Flask application.
   - Create a route for the '/hello' endpoint.
   
2. **API Endpoint**
   - Implement a function to handle GET requests to '/hello'.
   - Return a JSON response with the greeting message.

### Data Models and Schemas
There are no specific data models or schemas required for this simple API endpoint.

### API Specifications
- **Endpoint:** /hello
- **HTTP Method:** GET
- **Response Format:** JSON
- **Response Data:** {"message": "Hello, World!"}

### Interface Definitions
- **GET /hello**
  - Returns a JSON response with the greeting message.

### Design Patterns and Guidelines
- Use Flask for its simplicity in building REST APIs.
- Follow RESTful principles for designing the API endpoint.
- Keep the project structure simple due to its basic implementation.

Feel free to ask if you need further details or have any specific requirements for the technical design.
