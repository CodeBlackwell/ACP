# System Architecture Overview
The system will consist of a single REST API endpoint built using Flask. The application will respond with a JSON object containing the message "Hello World". The architecture will be simple, focusing on a single-file implementation for ease of understanding.

# Component Design
1. **API Component**: 
   - A single endpoint (`/hello`) that returns a JSON response.

# Data Models and Schemas
- No complex data models are required for this basic implementation. The response will be a simple JSON object.

# API Specifications
- **Endpoint**: `/hello`
- **Method**: GET
- **Response**: 
  ```json
  {
    "message": "Hello World"
  }
  ```

# Interface Definitions
- The API will be accessed via HTTP GET requests to the `/hello` endpoint.

# Design Patterns and Guidelines
- Use Flask for simplicity.
- Follow RESTful principles for API design.
- Ensure proper error handling and response formatting.
