# Project Overview
The goal of this project is to create a basic REST API endpoint in Python that returns a JSON response with the message "Hello World". This will serve as an introductory exercise in building RESTful services using Python.

# Technical Requirements
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Framework**: Flask (or FastAPI)
- **Response Format**: JSON
- **Development Environment**: Local machine with Python installed
- **Dependencies**: Flask or FastAPI, JSON library (included in Python standard library)

# Task Breakdown
1. **Set Up Development Environment**
   - Install Python (if not already installed)
   - Install Flask or FastAPI using pip
   - Create a new project directory

2. **Create the API Endpoint**
   - Initialize a new Python file (e.g., `app.py`)
   - Import necessary libraries (Flask or FastAPI)
   - Define the API endpoint that returns a JSON response

3. **Test the API Endpoint**
   - Run the application locally
   - Use a tool like Postman or curl to test the endpoint
   - Verify that the response is a JSON object with the message "Hello World"

4. **Documentation**
   - Write a brief README file explaining how to run the API
   - Include instructions for testing the endpoint

5. **Deployment (Optional)**
   - Consider deploying the API to a cloud service (e.g., Heroku, AWS) if time permits

# Architecture Recommendations
- Use Flask for simplicity and ease of use for beginners.
- Structure the project with a single file for this basic example, but consider modularization for larger projects.

# Risk Assessment
- **Technical Risks**: Potential issues with library installation or version compatibility.
- **Operational Risks**: Ensure the local environment is correctly set up to avoid runtime errors.
- **Mitigation Strategies**: Provide clear installation instructions and troubleshooting tips in the documentation. 

This plan provides a structured approach to developing a basic REST API in Python, ensuring clarity and focus on essential tasks.
