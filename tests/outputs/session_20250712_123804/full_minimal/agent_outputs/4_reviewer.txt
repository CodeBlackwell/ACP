The use of `jsonify` for returning JSON responses is appropriate.\n- The project structure is clear, with separate files for the application, requirements, README, and tests.\n\n### Security\n- There are no major security concerns in this simple API, as it does not handle sensitive data or user input. However, in a more complex application, consider implementing input validation and error handling.\n\n### Best Practices\n- The use of the MVC pattern is a good choice for organization, even in this simple application.\n- The README file provides clear setup instructions, which is essential for usability.\n- The test case in `test_app.py` is well-structured and effectively tests the API endpoint.\n\n### Final Decision\nAPPROVED. The implementation is functional, meets the core requirements, and is well-documented.', content_encoding='plain', content_url=None, metadata=None)], created_at=datetime.datetime(2025, 7, 12, 19, 38, 24, 273361, tzinfo=TzInfo(UTC)), completed_at=datetime.datetime(2025, 7, 12, 19, 38, 24, 274492, tzinfo=TzInfo(UTC)))]
