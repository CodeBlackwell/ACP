The architecture will follow the MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern to separate concerns and enhance maintainability.\n\n## Components:\n1. **API Layer**: Handles incoming requests and sends responses.\n2. **Controller**: Contains the logic for processing requests and returning responses.\n3. **Model**: Represents the data structure (if needed in the future).\n4. **View**: In this case, the view is represented by the JSON response.\n\n# Component Design\n- **API Layer**: \n  - Endpoint: `/hello`\n  - Method: `GET`\n  \n- **Controller**: \n  - Function: `hello_world()`\n  - Logic: Returns a JSON response with a greeting message.\n\n# Data Models and Schemas\nFor this basic API, no complex data models are required. The response will be a simple JSON object.\n\n# API Specifications\n- **Endpoint**: `/hello`\n- **Method**: `GET`\n- **Response**:\n  - Content-Type: `application/json`\n  - Body: \n    ```json\n    {\n      "message": "Hello, World!"\n    }\n    ```\n\n# Interface Definitions\n- **hello_world()**: \n  - Input: None\n  - Output: JSON response with a greeting message.\n\n# Design Patterns and Guidelines\n- Use the MVC pattern for organization.\n- Keep the API logic modular to allow for future scalability.\n- Ensure proper error handling and response formatting.\n\n# Implementation Plan\n===================\n\nFEATURE[1]: Set Up Development Environment\nDescription: Install necessary software and set up a Git repository.\nFiles: README.md\nValidation: Environment is set up correctly, and Git repository is initialized.\nDependencies: None\nEstimated Complexity: Low\n\nFEATURE[2]: Create Project Structure\nDescription: Create the project directory and initialize necessary files.\nFiles: app.py (for Flask) or server.js (for Express)\nValidation: Project structure is created with the main file present.\nDependencies: FEATURE[1]\nEstimated Complexity: Low\n\nFEATURE[3]: Implement the API Endpoint\nDescription: Define the `/hello` route and implement the `hello_world()` function.\nFiles: app.py (for Flask) or server.js (for Express)\nValidation: API endpoint returns a JSON response with the correct message.\nDependencies: FEATURE[2]\nEstimated Complexity: Medium\n\nFEATURE[4]: Test the API Endpoint\nDescription: Use Postman to test the `/hello` endpoint.\nFiles: None\nValidation: GET request to `/hello` returns the expected JSON response.\nDependencies: FEATURE[3]\nEstimated Complexity: Low\n\nFEATURE[5]: Documentation\nDescription: Write a README file explaining how to run and test the API.\nFiles: README.md\nValidation: README file contains clear instructions for setup and testing.\nDependencies: FEATURE[4]\nEstimated Complexity: Low\n\nFEATURE[6]: Version Control\nDescription: Commit changes to the Git repository and push to a remote repository.\nFiles: None\nValidation: Changes are committed and pushed successfully.\nDependencies: FEATURE[5]\nEstimated Complexity: Low', content_encoding='plain', content_url=None, metadata=None)], created_at=datetime.datetime(2025, 7, 12, 19, 38, 17, 189174, tzinfo=TzInfo(UTC)), completed_at=datetime.datetime(2025, 7, 12, 19, 38, 17, 190307, tzinfo=TzInfo(UTC)))]
