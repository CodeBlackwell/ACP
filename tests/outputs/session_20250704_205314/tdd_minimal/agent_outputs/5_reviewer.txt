Proper naming conventions are followed.\n\n#### Security\n- **Dependencies**: The use of `express` and `supertest` is standard for a REST API. Ensure that dependencies are kept up to date to avoid vulnerabilities.\n- **Input Validation**: While this is a simple endpoint, consider implementing input validation in more complex scenarios.\n\n#### Best Practices\n- **Error Handling**: There is no error handling in the API. It would be beneficial to add middleware for handling errors gracefully.\n- **Environment Variables**: The use of `process.env.PORT` is good practice for configuration. Ensure that other sensitive configurations are also managed through environment variables.\n\n#### Testing\n- **Coverage**: The tests cover the main functionality of the API. However, consider adding tests for error scenarios and edge cases.\n- **Framework**: The use of `jest` for testing is appropriate. Ensure that the testing framework is included in the `package.json`.\n\n#### Final Decision\nAPPROVED. The implementation is functional and meets the core requirements for a basic "Hello World" REST API. Consider the suggestions for improvements in error handling and testing coverage for future iterations.', content_encoding='plain', content_url=None, metadata=None)], created_at=datetime.datetime(2025, 7, 5, 0, 54, 2, 6323, tzinfo=TzInfo(UTC)), completed_at=datetime.datetime(2025, 7, 5, 0, 54, 2, 7213, tzinfo=TzInfo(UTC)))]
