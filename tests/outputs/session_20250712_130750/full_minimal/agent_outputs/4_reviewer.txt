AGENT: reviewer
============================================================



### Code Quality
- The project structure is well-organized, separating routes and controllers, which is a good practice.
- The use of Flask and blueprints is appropriate for this type of application.

### Security
- There are no major security concerns in this simple API, but consider implementing rate limiting and input validation in more complex scenarios.

### Best Practices
- The code adheres to the MVC pattern, which is good for maintainability.
- The use of environment variables for configuration is recommended, although not implemented here.

### Final Decision
APPROVED. The implementation is functional and meets the core requirements of the project.
