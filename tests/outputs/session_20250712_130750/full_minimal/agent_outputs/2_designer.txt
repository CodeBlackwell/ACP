============================================================



# System Architecture Overview
The system will consist of a simple REST API built using Flask (Python) or Express (Node.js). The architecture will follow a microservices approach, allowing for scalability and maintainability. The API will return JSON responses and will be containerized using Docker for consistency across development and production environments.

# Component Design
1. **API Server**: The main component that handles incoming requests and routes them to the appropriate handlers.
2. **Endpoint Handler**: A specific handler for the "/hello" endpoint that returns a JSON response.
3. **Development Environment**: Local setup with necessary libraries and tools for development and testing.

# Data Models and Schemas
- No complex data models are required for this simple API. The response will be a static JSON object.

# API Specifications
- **Endpoint**: `/hello`
- **Method**: `GET`
- **Response**: 
  ```json
  {
    "message": "Hello, World!"
  }
  ```

# Interface Definitions
- The API will expose a single interface for the `/hello` endpoint, which will return a JSON response.

# Design Patterns and Guidelines
- Use the MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern to separate concerns.
- Implement error handling to manage unexpected issues gracefully.
- Use environment variables for configuration management.

# Implementation Plan
IMPLEMENTATION PLAN:
===================

FEATURE[1]: Set Up Development Environment
Description: Install necessary programming language and framework, set up version control with Git, and create a new repository for the project.
Files: README.md, .gitignore
Validation: Development environment is set up, and the repository is initialized.
Dependencies: None
Estimated Complexity: Low

FEATURE[2]: Create Basic API Structure
Description: Initialize the project structure with folders for routes and controllers, and create the main application file (e.g., `app.py` for Flask).
Files: app.py, routes/hello.py, controllers/hello_controller.py
Validation: Application structure is created, and the main file is executable without errors.
Dependencies: FEATURE[1]
Estimated Complexity: Low

FEATURE[3]: Implement "Hello World" Endpoint
Description: Define a route for the `/hello` endpoint and implement the logic to return a JSON response.
Files: routes/hello.py, controllers/hello_controller.py
Validation: Endpoint returns the correct JSON response when accessed.
Dependencies: FEATURE[2]
Estimated Complexity: Medium

FEATURE[4]: Testing the Endpoint
Description: Use Postman or a similar tool to test the `/hello` endpoint and ensure it returns the correct JSON response.
Files: tests/test_hello.py
Validation: Tests confirm that the endpoint returns the expected JSON response.
Dependencies: FEATURE[3]
Estimated Complexity: Medium

FEATURE[5]: Documentation
Description: Write basic documentation on how to run the API and test the endpoint, including examples of requests and responses.
Files: README.md
Validation: Documentation is clear and provides necessary instructions for running and testing the API.
Dependencies: FEATURE[4]
Estimated Complexity: Low

FEATURE[6]: Deployment (Optional)
Description: Consider deploying the API to a cloud service and set up environment variables and configurations for production.
Files: Dockerfile, docker-compose.yml
Validation: API is successfully deployed and accessible in the cloud environment.
Dependencies: FEATURE[5]
Estimated Complexity: Medium
