### Project Plan: Creating a 'Hello World' REST API Endpoint

#### Project Overview:
The project aims to develop a simple 'Hello World' REST API endpoint that responds with a greeting message. This API will serve as a foundational component for future API development projects.

#### Technical Requirements:
1. Programming Language: Choose a language suitable for REST API development (e.g., Python, Node.js).
2. Framework: Select a framework that facilitates REST API development (e.g., Flask for Python, Express for Node.js).
3. API Endpoint: Implement a single endpoint that accepts HTTP GET requests and returns a JSON response with a greeting message.
4. Testing: Include unit tests to ensure the endpoint functions correctly.
5. Documentation: Provide clear documentation on how to use the API.

#### Task Breakdown:
1. **Research and Planning**
   - Research suitable programming languages and frameworks.
   - Define the API endpoint structure.
   
2. **Environment Setup**
   - Set up the development environment with the chosen language and framework.
   
3. **Endpoint Development**
   - Create the 'Hello World' endpoint.
   - Implement the logic to return a greeting message.
   
4. **Testing**
   - Write unit tests to validate the endpoint functionality.
   
5. **Documentation**
   - Document the API endpoint, including usage instructions.
   
6. **Integration**
   - Integrate the endpoint into a server for testing.

#### Architecture Recommendations:
- Use a lightweight framework to keep the API simple and easy to maintain.
- Consider scalability and potential future expansion when designing the endpoint structure.
- Implement best practices for RESTful API design to ensure consistency and usability.

#### Risk Assessment:
- **Technical Risks:**
  - Compatibility issues between chosen language and framework.
  - Lack of experience in REST API development may lead to delays.
- **Operational Risks:**
  - Inadequate testing may result in endpoint malfunctions.
  - Poor documentation could hinder adoption and usage.

This project plan provides a structured approach to developing a basic 'Hello World' REST API endpoint, focusing on simplicity, functionality, and maintainability.

2. DESIGNER OUTPUT:
==================================================

### System Architecture Overview:
The system will consist of a lightweight REST API developed using Python and Flask framework. It will include a single endpoint that responds with a JSON greeting message. Unit tests will ensure endpoint functionality, and clear documentation will be provided for API usage.

### Component Design:
1. **Programming Language:** Python
2. **Framework:** Flask
3. **API Endpoint:** /hello-world (HTTP GET)
4. **Data Model:** 
   - GreetingMessage: { "message": "Hello, World!" }
5. **Testing:** Unit tests using pytest
6. **Documentation:** Swagger UI for API documentation

### Data Models and Schemas:
- GreetingMessage:
  ```json
  {
    "message": "Hello, World!"
  }
  ```

### API Specifications:
- **Endpoint:** /hello-world
  - **Method:** GET
  - **Response:** 
    ```json
    {
      "message": "Hello, World!"
    }
    ```

### Interface Definitions:
1. GET /hello-world
   - Returns a JSON response with a greeting message.

### Design Patterns and Guidelines:
- Use the MVC pattern to separate concerns.
- Implement RESTful principles for API design.
- Follow SOLID principles for maintainable code.
- Use dependency injection for testability.

This design ensures a simple, functional, and maintainable 'Hello World' REST API endpoint as per the project plan provided.
