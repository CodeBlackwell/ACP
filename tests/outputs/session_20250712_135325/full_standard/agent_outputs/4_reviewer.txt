============================================================



### Code Quality
- The overall structure of the project is well-organized, following a clear MVC pattern.
- The use of blueprints in Flask for routing is a good practice for modularity.
- The database model is defined correctly, and the use of SQLAlchemy is appropriate for ORM.

### Security
- Ensure that user inputs are properly validated to prevent SQL injection and other vulnerabilities. The use of Marshmallow for validation is a good choice.
- Consider implementing authentication and authorization if this API is intended for public use.

### Best Practices
- The error handling implementation is basic but functional. Consider expanding it to cover more specific error cases.
- The use of `get_or_404` is a good practice for handling non-existent resources.
- The `to_dict()` method for the `Todo` model is assumed to be implemented but is not shown. Ensure it properly serializes the model.

### Final Decision
APPROVED. The implementation meets the core requirements and follows good practices. Ensure to add comprehensive tests and documentation as the project progresses.
