# System Architecture Overview
The system will consist of a single REST API endpoint built using Flask. The application will respond with a JSON object containing the message "Hello World". The architecture will be simple, focusing on a single-file implementation for ease of understanding.

# Component Design
- **Main Application**: A single Python file (`app.py`) that initializes the Flask application and defines the API endpoint.

# Data Models and Schemas
- No complex data models are required for this basic implementation. The response will be a simple JSON object.

# API Specifications
- **Endpoint**: `/hello`
- **Method**: `GET`
- **Response**: 
  ```json
  {
    "message": "Hello World"
  }
  ```

# Interface Definitions
- The API will be accessed via HTTP GET requests to the `/hello` endpoint.

# Design Patterns and Guidelines
- Use the Flask framework for simplicity.
- Follow RESTful principles for API design.
- Ensure the response is in JSON format.

Description: Install Python and Flask, and create a new project directory.
Files: requirements.txt
Validation: Python and Flask are installed, and the project directory is created.
Dependencies: None
Estimated Complexity: Low

FEATURE[2]: Create the API Endpoint
Description: Implement the Flask application and define the `/hello` endpoint that returns a JSON response.
Files: app.py
Validation: The application runs without errors, and the `/hello` endpoint returns the correct JSON response.
Dependencies: FEATURE[1]
