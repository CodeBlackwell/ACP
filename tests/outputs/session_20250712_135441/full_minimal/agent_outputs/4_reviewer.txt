AGENT: reviewer
============================================================



### Code Review

#### Code Quality
- The implementation is straightforward and adheres to the requirements. The use of Flask is appropriate for a simple REST API.
- The code is well-structured, with clear separation of concerns between the application logic and the testing.

#### Security
- There are no major security concerns in this basic implementation. However, ensure that the application is not exposed to the public without proper security measures in a production environment.

#### Best Practices
- The use of `jsonify` for returning JSON responses is a good practice.
- The README file provides clear instructions for setup and usage, which is essential for user experience.

#### Final Decision
- APPROVED. The implementation is functional, meets the core requirements, and is suitable for a basic REST API project.
