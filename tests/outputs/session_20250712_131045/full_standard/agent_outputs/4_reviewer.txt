AGENT: reviewer
============================================================



### Code Quality
- The code is well-structured and follows a clear MVC pattern, which enhances maintainability.
- The use of async/await in the routes is appropriate for handling asynchronous operations with MongoDB.

### Security
- Input validation is implemented using Joi, which is a good practice to prevent invalid data from being processed.
- Error handling middleware is in place, but consider enhancing it to provide more informative error messages based on the type of error.

### Best Practices
- The project adheres to RESTful principles, with clear endpoint definitions and appropriate HTTP methods.
- The README file provides clear setup instructions and API endpoint descriptions, which is essential for user understanding.

### Final Decision
APPROVED. The implementation is functional and addresses core requirements effectively. Consider minor improvements in error handling for better user feedback.
