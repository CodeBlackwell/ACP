# Project Plan: Creating a 'Hello World' REST API Endpoint

## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to develop a simple 'Hello World' REST API endpoint that responds with a greeting message. This API will serve as a foundational component for future API development projects.

## Technical Requirements
1. Programming Language: Choose a suitable language for API development (e.g., Python, Node.js).
2. Framework: Select a web framework that supports REST API development (e.g., Flask, Express).
3. API Endpoint: Implement a single endpoint that accepts HTTP GET requests.
4. Response: The API should respond with a JSON object containing a "message" key with the value "Hello, World!".
5. Testing: Develop unit tests to ensure the API endpoint functions as expected.
6. Documentation: Create clear documentation on how to use the API.

## Task Breakdown
1. Research and Select Programming Language and Framework (2 days)
2. Set Up Project Structure and Environment (1 day)
3. Implement 'Hello World' API Endpoint (2 days)
4. Write Unit Tests for API Endpoint (1 day)
5. Document API Usage (1 day)
6. Test API Endpoint and Debug (1 day)
7. Finalize Documentation and Code Review (1 day)

## Architecture Recommendations
- Use a lightweight framework to keep the API simple and easy to maintain.
- Implement separation of concerns to ensure code modularity and scalability.
- Consider deploying the API on a cloud platform for scalability and reliability.

## Risk Assessment
1. **Technical Risks**: Potential challenges in selecting the right framework for the project.
2. **Time Constraints**: Delays in development may impact the project timeline.
3. **Integration Issues**: Compatibility issues with external services or tools.
4. **Security Concerns**: Ensure proper handling of data and implement necessary security measures.

Feel free to ask if you need further details or clarification on any aspect of the project plan.
