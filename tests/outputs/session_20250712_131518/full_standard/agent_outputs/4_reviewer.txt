AGENT: reviewer
============================================================



### Code Quality
- The overall structure of the project is well-organized, with clear separation of concerns (models, routes, schemas, etc.).
- The use of Flask and SQLAlchemy is appropriate for this type of application.
- The implementation of the CRUD operations is straightforward and follows RESTful principles.

### Security
- Ensure that input validation is robust to prevent SQL injection and other common vulnerabilities. The use of Marshmallow for validation is a good choice.
- Consider adding authentication and authorization if the API will be exposed publicly.

### Best Practices
- The error handling implementation is basic but functional. Consider expanding it to handle specific exceptions more gracefully.
- The use of `onupdate=datetime.utcnow` in the model is correct, but ensure that the `updated_at` field is updated only when changes occur.
- The `__repr__` method in the `Todo` model should return a more informative string representation, possibly including the ID.

### Final Decision
APPROVED. The implementation meets the core requirements and is functional. Consider the suggestions for improvements, especially regarding security and error handling.
