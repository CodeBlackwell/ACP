Ensure that dependencies are kept up to date to avoid vulnerabilities.\n\n#### Best Practices\n- **Error Handling**: Consider adding error handling middleware in the Express app to manage unexpected errors gracefully.\n- **Environment Variables**: It's good practice to use environment variables for configuration (like the port), which is already implemented.\n\n#### Testing\n- **Coverage**: The tests cover the main functionality of the API, including response status, content type, and response time.\n- **Test Framework**: Using Jest and Supertest is a solid choice for testing Express applications.\n\n### Final Decision\nAPPROVED. The implementation meets the core requirements and is functional. Consider the suggested improvements for future iterations.", content_encoding='plain', content_url=None, metadata=None)], created_at=datetime.datetime(2025, 7, 5, 1, 47, 18, 162612, tzinfo=TzInfo(UTC)), completed_at=datetime.datetime(2025, 7, 5, 1, 47, 18, 163559, tzinfo=TzInfo(UTC)))]
