The architecture will follow a microservices approach, allowing for future scalability. The API will be built using Flask (Python) and will return JSON responses.\n\n# Component Design\n1. **API Service**: A Flask application that handles incoming requests and returns JSON responses.\n2. **Development Environment**: Local setup with Python, Flask, and Git for version control.\n\n# Data Models and Schemas\n- No complex data models are required for this basic API. The response will be a simple JSON object.\n\n# API Specifications\n- **Endpoint**: `/hello`\n- **Method**: GET\n- **Response**: \n  ```json\n  {\n    "message": "Hello, World!"\n  }\n  ```\n\n# Interface Definitions\n- The API will listen on a specified port (default 5000 for Flask) and respond to GET requests at the `/hello` endpoint.\n\n# Design Patterns and Guidelines\n- Follow RESTful principles for endpoint design.\n- Use JSON as the response format.\n- Implement error handling for unexpected scenarios.\n\n# Implementation Plan\nIMPLEMENTATION PLAN:\n===================\n\nFEATURE[1]: Set Up Development Environment\nDescription: Install necessary software and set up a Git repository.\nFiles: README.md\nValidation: Development environment is ready, and Git repository is initialized.\nDependencies: None\nEstimated Complexity: Low\n\nFEATURE[2]: Create Basic API Structure\nDescription: Initialize the Flask project with necessary files.\nFiles: app.py, requirements.txt\nValidation: Application structure is created without errors.\nDependencies: FEATURE[1]\nEstimated Complexity: Low\n\nFEATURE[3]: Implement the "Hello World" Endpoint\nDescription: Define the `/hello` route and return a JSON response.\nFiles: app.py\nValidation: Sending a GET request to `/hello` returns the expected JSON response.\nDependencies: FEATURE[2]\nEstimated Complexity: Medium\n\nFEATURE[4]: Test the API Endpoint\nDescription: Use Postman to test the `/hello` endpoint.\nFiles: None\nValidation: GET request to `/hello` returns the correct JSON response.\nDependencies: FEATURE[3]\nEstimated Complexity: Low\n\nFEATURE[5]: Document the API\nDescription: Create a README file with instructions for running and testing the API.\nFiles: README.md\nValidation: README contains clear instructions on how to run and test the API.\nDependencies: FEATURE[4]\nEstimated Complexity: Low\n\nFEATURE[6]: Version Control and Deployment (Optional)\nDescription: Commit code to Git and optionally deploy to a cloud service.\nFiles: None\nValidation: Code is committed to Git, and deployment instructions are provided.\nDependencies: FEATURE[5]\nEstimated Complexity: Low', content_encoding='plain', content_url=None, metadata=None)], created_at=datetime.datetime(2025, 7, 5, 2, 2, 24, 165115, tzinfo=TzInfo(UTC)), completed_at=datetime.datetime(2025, 7, 5, 2, 2, 24, 166030, tzinfo=TzInfo(UTC)))]
