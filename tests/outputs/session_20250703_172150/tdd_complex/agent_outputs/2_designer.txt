Authentication will be handled using JWT, payment processing integrated through the Stripe API, email notifications sent via Nodemailer, and API documentation created using Swagger. The architecture will follow microservices principles for scalability, utilize RESTful APIs for communication, deploy the frontend on a CDN for performance, leverage Docker for containerization, and implement CI/CD pipelines for automated testing and deployment.\n\n### Component Design\n1. **Frontend Components**:\n   - User Authentication Forms\n   - Product Catalog UI\n   - Shopping Cart Functionality\n   - Admin Dashboard Interface\n\n2. **Backend Components**:\n   - User Authentication Endpoints\n   - Product Management APIs\n   - Order Management System\n   - Payment Processing Integration\n   - Email Notification Service\n\n### Data Models and Schemas\n1. **MongoDB Database Schema**:\n   - Products Collection\n   - Users Collection\n   - Orders Collection\n\n### API Specifications\n1. **Authentication API**:\n   - POST /auth/login\n   - POST /auth/register\n   - POST /auth/logout\n\n2. **Product Management API**:\n   - GET /products\n   - POST /products\n   - PUT /products/:id\n   - DELETE /products/:id\n\n3. **Order Management API**:\n   - GET /orders\n   - POST /orders\n   - PUT /orders/:id\n   - DELETE /orders/:id\n\n### Interface Definitions\n1. **Frontend-Backend Communication**:\n   - RESTful API Endpoints for data exchange\n   - JWT Tokens for user authentication\n\n### Design Patterns and Guidelines\n1. **Microservices Architecture**:\n   - Decoupled services for scalability\n   - Independent deployment and scaling of components\n\n2. **RESTful API Design**:\n   - Resource-based endpoints for CRUD operations\n   - Standard HTTP methods for actions\n\n3. **Containerization with Docker**:\n   - Encapsulate components for portability\n   - Consistent environment across development and production\n\n4. **CI/CD Pipelines**:\n   - Automated testing and deployment processes\n   - Continuous integration for code changes\n\nThis technical design aligns with the project plan's requirements and ensures a robust, scalable, and maintainable e-commerce application.", content_encoding='plain', content_url=None, metadata=None)], created_at=datetime.datetime(2025, 7, 3, 21, 22, 5, 509409, tzinfo=TzInfo(UTC)), completed_at=datetime.datetime(2025, 7, 3, 21, 22, 5, 510236, tzinfo=TzInfo(UTC)))]
