However, consider adding input validation and sanitization for more complex applications.\n\n#### Best Practices\n- The API correctly returns a JSON response and handles 404 errors.\n- The README file provides clear setup instructions, which is good for usability.\n- Consider using environment variables for configuration (e.g., PORT) to enhance flexibility.\n\n#### Testing\n- The tests are comprehensive and cover both the valid and invalid endpoints.\n- The use of Jest and Supertest for testing is appropriate and follows best practices.\n\n#### Final Decision\nAPPROVED.
