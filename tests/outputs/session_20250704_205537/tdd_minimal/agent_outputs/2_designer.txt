The architecture will follow the MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern to separate concerns and enhance maintainability.\n\n# Component Design\n1. **API Layer**: Handles incoming requests and routes them to the appropriate controller.\n2. **Controller Layer**: Contains the logic for processing requests and returning responses.\n3. **Model Layer**: Although not strictly necessary for a "Hello World" API, this layer can be included for future scalability.\n\n# Data Models and Schemas\n- No complex data models are required for this basic API. The response will be a simple JSON object.\n\n# API Specifications\n- **Endpoint**: `/hello`\n- **Method**: GET\n- **Response**: \n  ```json\n  {\n    "message": "Hello World"\n  }\n  ```\n\n# Interface Definitions\n- **GET /hello**: Returns a JSON response with a "Hello World" message.\n\n# Design Patterns and Guidelines\n- Use the MVC pattern to separate routing and business logic.\n- Ensure that the API returns responses in JSON format.\n- Implement error handling for robustness.\n\n# Implementation Plan\n===================\n\nFEATURE[1]: Set Up Development Environment\nDescription: Install necessary software and set up a Git repository.\nFiles: README.md\nValidation: Environment is set up correctly, and Git repository is initialized.\nDependencies: None\nEstimated Complexity: Low\n\nFEATURE[2]: Create Project Structure\nDescription: Create the project directory and initialize necessary files.\nFiles: app.py (for Flask) or server.js (for Express)\nValidation: Project structure is created with the main file present.\nDependencies: FEATURE[1]\nEstimated Complexity: Low\n\nFEATURE[3]: Implement the API Endpoint\nDescription: Define the `/hello` route and implement the function to return a JSON response.\nFiles: app.py (for Flask) or server.js (for Express)\nValidation: Sending a GET request to `/hello` returns the correct JSON response.\nDependencies: FEATURE[2]\nEstimated Complexity: Medium\n\nFEATURE[4]: Test the API Endpoint\nDescription: Use Postman or curl to test the API endpoint.\nFiles: None (testing is done externally)\nValidation: Successful GET request returns the expected JSON response.\nDependencies: FEATURE[3]\nEstimated Complexity: Low\n\nFEATURE[5]: Documentation\nDescription: Write a README file with setup and testing instructions.\nFiles: README.md\nValidation: README file contains clear instructions for setup and testing.\nDependencies: FEATURE[4]\nEstimated Complexity: Low\n\nFEATURE[6]: Version Control\nDescription: Commit changes to the Git repository and push to a remote repository.\nFiles: None (version control is managed through Git)\nValidation: Changes are committed and pushed to the remote repository.\nDependencies: FEATURE[5]\nEstimated Complexity: Low', content_encoding='plain', content_url=None, metadata=None)], created_at=datetime.datetime(2025, 7, 5, 0, 56, 1, 627919, tzinfo=TzInfo(UTC)), completed_at=datetime.datetime(2025, 7, 5, 0, 56, 1, 628743, tzinfo=TzInfo(UTC)))]
