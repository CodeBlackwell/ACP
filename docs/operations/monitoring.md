# Monitoring Guide

Guide for monitoring the Multi-Agent Orchestrator System in production.

## üöß Under Construction

This documentation is currently being developed. For basic monitoring, check:
- Log files in `logs/` directory
- Health endpoint at `http://localhost:8000/health`

## Overview

Effective monitoring ensures system reliability and helps identify issues before they impact users.

## Key Metrics

### System Metrics
- **CPU Usage**: Monitor orchestrator and API server CPU
- **Memory Usage**: Track memory consumption per service
- **Disk I/O**: Monitor generated code directory growth
- **Network**: API request/response times

### Application Metrics
- **Workflow Execution Time**: Average time per workflow type
- **Success Rate**: Percentage of successful completions
- **Agent Performance**: Time spent in each agent
- **Error Rate**: Failures per workflow type

### Business Metrics
- **Workflows Executed**: Total count per day/hour
- **Code Generated**: Lines of code produced
- **User Sessions**: Active and total sessions
- **Feature Usage**: Which workflows are most used

## Monitoring Tools

### 1. Built-in Monitoring
```python
# Check logs
tail -f logs/orchestrator.log
tail -f logs/api.log

# Session tracking
ls -la logs/demo_*/
```

### 2. Prometheus Integration
```yaml
# prometheus.yml
scrape_configs:
  - job_name: 'orchestrator'
    static_configs:
      - targets: ['localhost:8080']
  - job_name: 'api'
    static_configs:
      - targets: ['localhost:8000']
```

### 3. Grafana Dashboards
- Workflow execution dashboard
- Agent performance dashboard
- System health dashboard
- Error tracking dashboard

## Health Checks

### API Health Check
```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/health
```

### Orchestrator Health Check
```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/status
```

### Docker Health Checks
```yaml
healthcheck:
  test: ["CMD", "curl", "-f", "http://localhost:8000/health"]
  interval: 30s
  timeout: 10s
  retries: 3
```

## Alerting

### Critical Alerts
- Service down
- High error rate (>10%)
- Disk space low (<10%)
- Memory usage high (>90%)

### Warning Alerts
- Slow response times
- Increased retry rate
- Queue backlog growing
- Certificate expiration

## Log Management

### Log Levels
- ERROR: System errors requiring attention
- WARNING: Issues that may need investigation
- INFO: Normal operational messages
- DEBUG: Detailed debugging information

### Log Rotation
```bash
# logrotate configuration
/var/log/orchestrator/*.log {
    daily
    rotate 7
    compress
    missingok
    notifempty
}
```

## Performance Monitoring

### Response Time Tracking
- API endpoint response times
- Workflow execution duration
- Agent processing time
- Database query performance

### Resource Usage
- CPU utilization per service
- Memory consumption trends
- Network bandwidth usage
- Docker container stats
