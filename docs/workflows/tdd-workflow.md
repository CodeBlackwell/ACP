# TDD Workflow

## Overview

The Test-Driven Development (TDD) workflow implements a rigorous development approach where tests are written before the implementation code. This workflow ensures high code quality, comprehensive test coverage, and reliable software delivery.

## Workflow Phases

### 1. Planning Phase
- Analyze requirements and break down into testable components
- Define acceptance criteria
- Create high-level architecture design
- Identify test scenarios

### 2. Design Phase
- Create detailed technical design
- Define API contracts and interfaces
- Design data models and schemas
- Plan integration points

### 3. Test Writing Phase
- Write unit tests for each component
- Create integration tests for workflows
- Define test fixtures and mocks
- Establish test coverage targets

### 4. Implementation Phase
- Implement code to pass the tests
- Follow the red-green-refactor cycle
- Write minimal code to make tests pass
- Refactor for clarity and efficiency

### 5. Execution Phase
- Run all tests to verify implementation
- Check test coverage metrics
- Validate against acceptance criteria
- Fix any failing tests

### 6. Review Phase
- Code review by the reviewer agent
- Verify adherence to TDD principles
- Check code quality and standards
- Approve or request revisions

## Configuration

```python
TDD_WORKFLOW_CONFIG = {
    "max_retries": 3,
    "test_coverage_threshold": 80,
    "enable_integration_tests": True,
    "execution_timeout": 60,
    "auto_approve_after_retries": True
}
```

## Usage Example

```bash
# Using the run.py script
python run.py workflow tdd --task "Create a REST API for user management"

# Using the API
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/execute-workflow \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "requirements": "Create a REST API for user management with CRUD operations",
    "workflow_type": "tdd"
  }'
```

## Best Practices

1. **Write Meaningful Tests**: Tests should clearly express the expected behavior
2. **One Test at a Time**: Focus on making one test pass before writing the next
3. **Refactor Regularly**: Clean up code after tests pass
4. **Test Independence**: Each test should be able to run independently
5. **Fast Feedback**: Keep tests fast for rapid development cycles

## Error Handling

The TDD workflow includes robust error handling:
- Automatic retry on test failures (up to 3 attempts)
- Detailed error messages for debugging
- Fallback to manual review after max retries
- Execution timeout protection

## Integration with Other Workflows

The TDD workflow can be combined with:
- **MVP Incremental Workflow**: For feature-by-feature TDD development
- **Full Workflow**: As a quality assurance layer
- **Individual Steps**: For targeted TDD on specific components

## Monitoring and Metrics

Track TDD workflow performance with:
- Test execution time
- Test coverage percentage
- Number of test iterations
- Code-to-test ratio
- Defect detection rate

## Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions:

1. **Tests Timing Out**
   - Increase `execution_timeout` in configuration
   - Check for infinite loops in tests
   - Verify external dependencies are available

2. **Low Test Coverage**
   - Review untested code paths
   - Add edge case tests
   - Check coverage report for gaps

3. **Flaky Tests**
   - Eliminate timing dependencies
   - Mock external services
   - Ensure test data consistency
