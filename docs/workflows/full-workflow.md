# Full Workflow

## Overview

The Full Workflow is a comprehensive software development workflow that takes requirements through planning, design, implementation, and review phases. It provides a complete end-to-end solution for generating production-ready code from natural language requirements.

## Workflow Phases

### 1. Planning Phase
- Analyze and decompose requirements
- Create project structure
- Define component architecture
- Identify dependencies and integrations
- Produce a detailed implementation plan

### 2. Design Phase
- Create technical specifications
- Design system architecture
- Define data models and APIs
- Plan component interactions
- Document design decisions

### 3. Implementation Phase
- Generate code based on design specifications
- Implement business logic
- Create necessary utilities and helpers
- Handle error cases and edge conditions
- Follow coding best practices

### 4. Review Phase
- Automated code review
- Check adherence to standards
- Verify implementation matches requirements
- Suggest improvements
- Approve or request revisions

## Configuration

```python
FULL_WORKFLOW_CONFIG = {
    "enable_parallel_processing": True,
    "max_review_iterations": 3,
    "code_style": "PEP8",  # or "Google", "Airbnb"
    "enable_type_hints": True,
    "generate_docstrings": True,
    "output_directory": "./generated/"
}
```

## Usage Example

```bash
# Using the run.py script
python run.py workflow full --task "Create a task management application with REST API"

# Using the REST API
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/execute-workflow \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "requirements": "Create a task management application with user authentication, task CRUD operations, and team collaboration features",
    "workflow_type": "full"
  }'
```

## Workflow Features

### Intelligent Planning
- Breaks down complex requirements into manageable components
- Identifies technical challenges early
- Creates realistic timelines and milestones
- Considers scalability and maintainability

### Comprehensive Design
- Produces detailed technical specifications
- Creates UML diagrams when applicable
- Documents API endpoints and data flows
- Considers security and performance

### Quality Implementation
- Generates clean, well-structured code
- Includes error handling and validation
- Creates unit tests alongside code
- Follows SOLID principles

### Thorough Review
- Automated code quality checks
- Security vulnerability scanning
- Performance analysis
- Documentation completeness

## Best Practices

1. **Clear Requirements**: Provide detailed, unambiguous requirements
2. **Iterative Refinement**: Review and refine outputs at each phase
3. **Version Control**: Commit generated code to track changes
4. **Testing**: Always run generated tests before deployment
5. **Documentation**: Review generated documentation for accuracy

## Advanced Features

### Custom Templates
```python
workflow_config = {
    "template": "microservice",  # or "cli", "library", "web-app"
    "framework": "fastapi",      # or "flask", "django", "none"
    "database": "postgresql"     # or "mysql", "mongodb", "sqlite"
}
```

### Integration Options
- GitHub integration for automatic PR creation
- CI/CD pipeline configuration generation
- Docker containerization support
- Cloud deployment configurations

## Performance Optimization

- Caches common patterns for faster generation
- Parallel processing of independent components
- Incremental generation for large projects
- Resource-aware execution

## Error Handling

The Full Workflow includes comprehensive error handling:
- Graceful degradation on partial failures
- Detailed error messages with resolution steps
- Automatic retry with backoff
- Manual intervention points

## Comparison with Other Workflows

| Feature | Full Workflow | TDD Workflow | MVP Incremental |
|---------|--------------|--------------|-----------------|
| Scope | Complete solution | Test-first development | Feature-by-feature |
| Speed | Moderate | Slower | Fastest |
| Quality | High | Highest | Good |
| Flexibility | Moderate | Low | High |
| Best For | New projects | Critical systems | Iterative development |

## Monitoring and Metrics

Track workflow performance:
- Generation time per phase
- Code quality scores
- Review iteration count
- Success rate
- Resource utilization

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Generation Taking Too Long**
   - Break down requirements into smaller chunks
   - Enable parallel processing
   - Check system resource availability

2. **Poor Code Quality**
   - Provide more specific requirements
   - Include example code patterns
   - Adjust code style configuration

3. **Review Failures**
   - Check review criteria configuration
   - Examine reviewer agent logs
   - Manually review edge cases
