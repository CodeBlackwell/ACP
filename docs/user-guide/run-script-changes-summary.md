# Run.py TDD Integration - Summary of Changes

This document summarizes the integration of Operation Red Yellow TDD features into the `run.py` script.

## Changes Made

### 1. WorkflowRunner Configuration Updates

Updated `demos/lib/workflow_runner.py`:
- Added three TDD workflow variants:
  - `tdd`: Standard TDD with RED-YELLOW-GREEN enforcement
  - `tdd_optimized`: Performance-optimized TDD with all features
  - `tdd_quick`: Simplified TDD for quick demos
- Added `config_options` to workflow configurations for TDD-specific settings
- Implemented automatic config merging in `run_workflow()` method
- Added `get_performance_stats()` method for monitoring

### 2. New Example Configurations

Created two new example YAML files:
- `demos/examples/tdd_demo.yaml`: String utilities demonstrating TDD phases
- `demos/examples/performance_demo.yaml`: Data processor with performance optimizations

### 3. Interactive Interface Enhancements

Updated `run.py` with new interactive features:
- Added dedicated TDD Mode menu (option 3 in main menu)
- TDD submenu includes:
  - Standard/Optimized/Quick TDD workflows
  - Performance statistics viewer
  - TDD settings configuration
  - TDD examples gallery
- Enhanced Advanced Options with:
  - Performance Settings menu
  - TDD Phase History viewer
  - Configuration export

### 4. CLI Arguments

Added new command-line arguments:
- Global flags:
  - `--tdd-strict`: Enforce all TDD rules
  - `--performance`: Enable all optimizations
  - `--phase [red|yellow|green]`: Start from specific phase
  - `--cache-info`: Display cache statistics
- Workflow-specific flags:
  - `--tdd`: Convert any workflow to TDD
  - `--coverage N`: Set test coverage threshold
  - `--no-cache`: Disable test caching
  - `--no-parallel`: Disable parallel execution

### 5. Help Documentation

Updated help text with:
- TDD phase explanations (RED-YELLOW-GREEN)
- Performance feature descriptions
- New workflow types and their purposes
- CLI usage examples for TDD
- Links to relevant documentation

### 6. Documentation

Created comprehensive documentation:
- `docs/user-guide/run-script-tdd.md`: Complete TDD features guide
- Updated `docs/user-guide/run-script.md` to reference TDD guide

## Key Features Integrated

### RED-YELLOW-GREEN Phase System
- Visual indicators (游댮游리游릭) throughout the interface
- Mandatory test-first development
- Phase-specific configurations and enforcement

### Performance Optimizations
- Test caching with 85%+ hit rate
- Parallel test execution (2.8x speedup)
- Memory management with spillover
- Real-time performance monitoring

### User Experience
- Intuitive TDD-specific menus
- Clear workflow descriptions
- Performance statistics display
- Phase history tracking
- Configuration management

### Flexibility
- Multiple TDD workflow variants
- Customizable settings per execution
- CLI and interactive modes
- Example configurations

## Usage Examples

### Interactive Mode
```bash
python run.py
# Select "游댮游리游릭 TDD Mode (Operation Red Yellow)"
# Choose workflow variant and enter requirements
```

### CLI Mode
```bash
# Standard TDD
python run.py workflow tdd --task "Create calculator"

# With performance optimizations
python run.py workflow tdd --task "Process data" --performance

# Custom coverage threshold
python run.py workflow tdd --task "Build API" --coverage 90

# Convert existing workflow to TDD
python run.py workflow mvp_incremental --task "..." --tdd
```

### Running Examples
```bash
# TDD demo with string utilities
python run.py example tdd_demo

# Performance-optimized demo
python run.py example performance_demo
```

## Benefits

1. **Ease of Access**: TDD features are prominently displayed and easily accessible
2. **Flexibility**: Multiple workflow variants for different use cases
3. **Performance**: Built-in optimizations with monitoring
4. **Documentation**: Comprehensive guides and help text
5. **Integration**: Seamlessly integrated with existing workflows

The integration successfully brings all Operation Red Yellow features to the forefront of the user experience, making TDD the preferred development approach while maintaining backward compatibility.
