**Solution**:
1. Start the orchestrator in a separate terminal:

   python orchestrator/orchestrator_agent.py
   ```
2. Verify it's running on port 8080
3. Keep the terminal open while using the system

### Missing Dependencies
**Problem**: Import errors or missing package errors.

**Solution**:
1. Ensure virtual environment is activated:
   ```bash
   source .venv/bin/activate
   ```
2. Reinstall dependencies:
   ```bash
   uv pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### API Key Errors
**Problem**: Authentication errors or API key not found.

**Solution**:
1. Check `.env` file exists (copy from `.env.example` if needed)
